## General
GiStorm is Go binding for Distorm3 v3.3 written by Gil Dabah [http://ragestorm.net/distorm/]

Binding is loosly based on the frasm Ruby binding, originally written by Tom Ptacek and has since been updated by Chris Rohlf and myself.

GiStorm requires you have built and installed libdistorm:

Make sure dowload and build distorm3.3, and that you have the libdistorm3.so (linux) / distorm3.dylib (mac) under your search path
